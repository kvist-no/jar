# Kvist's Pkl Jar

**Welcome to Kvist's `pkl` jar!**

Here's a collection of our `pkl` modules that we use internally. We thought we should open source it to allow others
to benefit from them as well.

## Packages

```pkl
dependencies {
  ["docker-compose"] {
    uri = "package://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvist-no/jar/main/packages/docker-compose/build/docker-compose@<VERSION>"
  }
}
```
